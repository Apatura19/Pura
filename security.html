        <h4>"Viruses"</h4>
        <p>In today's digital age, computer viruses have become a major threat to the security and performance of our devices. Whether you're browsing the web, downloading files, or sending emails, it's important to understand what viruses are, how they spread, and how to protect your system from potential damage. In this blog, we'll explore the various types of computer viruses, their effects, and how you can safeguard your data from them.</p>
        <h2>Common Types of Computer Viruses</h2>
        <p>1. File Infector Virus: A file infector virus attaches itself to executable files, such as .exe or .com files. When these infected files are opened, the virus activates and starts replicating itself, often damaging or corrupting other files in the process. These viruses can cause programs to crash or behave erratically.</p>
        <p>2. Macro Virus Macro: viruses target documents created by programs like Microsoft Word, Excel, and other productivity software. These viruses spread by embedding themselves within the macros in documents. When the document is opened and the macros are enabled, the virus is activated. Often, macro viruses are spread through email attachments and downloads.</p>
        <p>3.Boot Sector Virus: Boot sector viruses are a particularly dangerous type of virus that targets the master boot record (MBR) of a computer’s hard drive or removable storage devices like USB drives. These viruses activate during the boot-up process, and they can prevent the system from starting or cause instability.</p>
        <p>4.Worm: Worms are self-replicating viruses that spread across networks without any user interaction. Unlike file infector viruses, worms don’t need to attach themselves to programs. They often spread through vulnerabilities in network security and can cause significant damage by consuming bandwidth and overwhelming systems with multiple copies of the worm.</p>
        <h2>How Do Computer Viruses Spread?</h2>
        <p>Email Attachments: Malicious email attachments are a common way for viruses to spread. Opening an infected attachment can trigger the virus and allow it to propagate to other systems.</p>
        <p>Websites and Ads: Some viruses are distributed through infected websites or deceptive online ads (malvertising). Simply visiting a website or clicking on a malicious ad can trigger a virus download.</p>
        <h2>How to Protect Your Computer from Viruses</h2>
        <p>Install Antivirus Software One of the most effective ways to prevent virus infections is by installing reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and block malicious software, including viruses, worms, and spyware.</p>

        <h2>How to Protect Your Computer from Malware</h2>
        <p>Install Antivirus Software:A good antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it can harm your system. Ensure that your antivirus software is regularly updated to stay ahead of new threats.</p>
        <p>Be Cautious with Email Attachments:Never open email attachments from unknown sources or click on suspicious links. If you’re unsure about an email’s legitimacy, verify with the sender before opening any files.</p>
        <p>Educate Yourself and Others: Stay informed about the latest threats and teach others about good online security practices. A well-informed user is less likely to fall for phishing attacks or other social engineering tactics</p>

        <h4>"Spam"</h4>
        <p>Spam refers to unsolicited, usually irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over the internet, often in bulk. The most common form of spam is email spam, but it can also appear in other areas like social media, instant messaging apps, and even comments sections of blogs and websites.These messages are typically sent by advertisers, scammers, or even bots to promote products, services, or sometimes, to spread malware.</p>
        <h2>Types of Spam</h2>
        <p>Email Spam:The most familiar form of spam, where users receive bulk, unsolicited emails, often promoting dubious products, services, or offers. Some emails may even attempt to steal personal information through phishing schemes.</p>
        <p>Social Media Spam:Spam on social media platforms can take the form of fake accounts, irrelevant posts, or comments. These messages often contain links to malicious websites or advertisements.</p>
        <p>Comment Spam:Common on blogs or forums, comment spam involves irrelevant or unwanted posts that usually advertise products or links. This type of spam is often automated, posted by bots.</p>
        <p>Instant Messaging Spam:Also known as "spammy" messages, these are unsolicited messages sent over chat services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or even SMS. These often promote fake offers or scams.</p>
        
        <h2>How Does Spam Affect You?</h2>
        <p>Security Risks:Some spam messages, particularly phishing emails, contain malicious attachments or links that, if clicked, can install malware or viruses on your computer. This can lead to data theft, identity theft, or system corruption.</p>
        <p>Privacy Threats:Spammers often collect your email address or other personal information for future targeted attacks. They might sell your data to other entities or use it to send more spam.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Spam</h2>
        <p>Don’t Click on Suspicious Links:Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or unsolicited messages. Always verify the sender’s address before opening any email.</p>
        <p>Report Spam:If you receive spam messages, report them to your email provider or the platform hosting the spam. This helps improve filtering systems for everyone.</p>
        <p>Use Antivirus Software:Antivirus programs can help detect and block malware, phishing attempts, and other threats that can come with spam messages.</p>
